# DragOPSongTranslate

Create your <i>own songs</i> to work with DragOP for SingSong.
You could create your own chat presets with it, I guess.

<b>How To Add Songs</b>

Add the text in output.txt to DragOP.js line 4160(as of 3/2/17 Beta Build) probably going to need explorer the JS file for newer/release versions.

You can look for "songList: [" in the JS file, hopefully that helps.

Why the copy? I want to keep this one for major changes, and the original for every day tiny changes! :)
